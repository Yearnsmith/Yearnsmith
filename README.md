# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am currently** a student at [Coder Academy](https://github.com/coder-academy-students), learning MEARN stack.

## Current portfolio:
[http://yearnsmith.netlify.app](http://yearnsmith.netlify.app)

**Most of my** repos are private learning activities, Im slowly cleaning them up for public viewing. Once I know what I'm doing, I'd love to start contributing to FOSS projects.

**Reach me on*** GitHub or at `d.yearnsmith`&zwj;*&lbrack;at&rbrack;*&zwj;`gmail.com`

## Superfluous information about me:
- I have a background in Theatre
- I'm getting into FOSS (I get excited for the LibreOffice changelog when there's an update).
- I'm a stickler for the proper use of em dashes, en dashes, and ellipsies (instead of hyphens and periods). I have learned the en and em dash `alt` codes by heart (`0150` & `0151`, respectively). I'm still memorising their unicode blocksâ€¦
