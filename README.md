# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a Web Developer in Brisbane, Australia.**

I'm a web developer and world-wide-web enthusiast in Brisbane, Australia.

I've recently finished up contracting for TalentVine. Though I've been hacking away in the frontend since ~2003.

Getting serious in 2020 I joined Coder Academy to upskill beyond HTML/CSS â€” they taught Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, nodejs, React, Git, and CS fundamentals.

Since then I've leveled up my react & rails, learned some Python, dabbled in Bash scripting* and used a bunch of tools like Jira, Figma, and GitLab.

### Loves:

- beautiful front-ends
- accessible websites
- graceful degradation
- indie web charm & whacky websites

### Also Loves:

- The challenge of building SPA's
- learning new systems, languages, and processes

## Contact

**Reach me on** GitHub or at `d.yearnsmith`&zwj;*&lbrack;at&rbrack;*&zwj;`gmail.com`

## Superfluous information about me:

- I have a background in Theatre
- I rely largly on FOSS software.
- I'm a stickler for the proper use of em dashes, en dashes, and ellipsies (in place of hyphens and periods).
